# Transfer-Learning---Approach-in-PCB-inspection

The printed circuit board (PCB) have many component’s, components like resistor divided into many classes according to their resistor values, the industries using machine learning algorithm’s to differentiate between these resistors classes, each one have their specific purpose, the problem comes when PCB replaced with a new set of images for certain classes, the new class resistor might behave new resistor values or can be placed in different order on PCB, our aim is to successfully detect those new images and classify according to which class it belongs with min error, and without building and training model from scratch. Transfer learning is the approach by which we can obtain our expected result, we don’t have to train the model from scratch.
